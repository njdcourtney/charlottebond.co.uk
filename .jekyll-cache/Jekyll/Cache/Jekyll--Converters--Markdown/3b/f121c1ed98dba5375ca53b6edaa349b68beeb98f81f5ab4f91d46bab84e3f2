I"ƒ<p><strong><em>2019 is the year of the prince!</em></strong></p>

<p>Throughout 2018, I asked friends and contacts what they thought made a good princess. You can find the answers to those questions <a href="/categories/princequestions.html">here</a></p>

<p>This year, I will be asking authors from a variety of genres as well as a host of others from editors to academics, what they think makes a definitive prince.</p>

<p>To kick us off is Megan Leigh.</p>

<p><strong><em>1. A prince has to win the trust not only of his people but of his chosen princess - and very quickly! What three qualities would you need a prince to show before youâ€™d be won over to their cause?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Personality</strong>
This is why I struggle with some of the older Disney filmsâ€¦ the princes had so little characterisation that it was impossible to feel much of anything for them.</p>

<p>Take Cinderellaâ€™s Prince Charming, for instance. I donâ€™t think I could tell you a single thing about his personality.</p>

<p>Who wants a Prince who is nothing more than his title?</p>

<p><strong>Honesty</strong>
If Aladdin taught me anything, itâ€™s that a prince is only worth his salt once he starts telling the truth. I didnâ€™t fancy â€˜Prince Aliâ€™ either, but street-rat Aladdin? Yes, please!</p>

<p><strong>A great singing voice</strong>
Whatâ€™s a prince without a song? (I realise these questions arenâ€™t necessarily Disney related, but thatâ€™s the way Iâ€™ve taken it.)</p>

<p>I donâ€™t want a prince who is grounded or wise, I want one who can serenade me, dammit!</p>

<p><strong><em>2. All princes are armed, but what is the best weapon or weapons for a prince? (Magical weapons are allowed).</em></strong></p>

<p>Great wit. Anyone can learn to be proficient with a physical weapon, but only the intelligent ones with real spark can learn to launch precision verbal hits.</p>

<p><strong><em>3. Disney princesses often have an animal companion to share their trials with. If the same applied to princes, what kind of animal would be a good choice for a prince?</em></strong></p>

<p>Definitely a talking cat. To match a princeâ€™s acerbic wit, he needs an animal who can keep up with his verbal sparring with twice the sarcasm.</p>

<p>Cats are also the perfect creatures to keep an ear to the ground for courtly politics and gossip.</p>

<p>And whereâ€™s the fun in an animal familiar that does what it is told? A cat will provide endless trouble, ignoring instructions or making situations worse. The perfect narrative foil!</p>

<p><strong><em>4. The Disney princes were a pretty unmemorable bunch. What kind of prince - or saviour-hero - would you like to see in future Disney movies?</em></strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned before, it all comes down to personality. I want a prince who has enough characterisation to have defined motivations and something about them that is incidental to the main plot.</p>

<p>But I think, most importantly, Iâ€™d like to see a prince who regularly turns to the princess for advice rather than the default reliance on skepticism when it comes to first seeing a capable young woman. There are other ways to create tension! Have him be blown away by her intelligence and self-reliance from the get-go!</p>

<p><strong><em>5. The focus on princesses is often what they wear, but what would be a good look for your ideal prince?</em></strong></p>

<p>He can wear whatever he likes as long as heâ€™s got a good ass! :)</p>

<p><strong><em>6. Which fictional prince is your favourite, and why?</em></strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to move away from Disney here and choose Prince Verity from Robin Hobbâ€™s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Farseer-Trilogy-Assassins-Apprentice-ebook/dp/B00D0VYE26/"><em>Farseer Trilogy</em></a>.</p>

<p>He is basically the fantasy novel version of Jean-Luc Picard. Serious and sensible, with a great heart. I also really relate to his struggles when it comes to people who are entirely self interested and work to undermine what is best for everyone.</p>
