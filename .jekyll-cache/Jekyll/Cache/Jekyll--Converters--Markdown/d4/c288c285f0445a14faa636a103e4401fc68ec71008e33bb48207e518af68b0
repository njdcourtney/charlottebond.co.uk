I"0<p>Those who read my posts over at <a href="http://gingernutsofhorror.com/index.html">Ginger Nuts of Horror</a> will know that I try to be fair in my reviews. Iâ€™ve only ever had one book where I was so appalled by the writing that I felt unable to write anything positive in a review. There is usually something of merit in most things. And if you want scathing film reviews, I would suggest checking out the <a href="http://pop-verse.com/">Pop Verse</a> website, run by my Breaking the Glass Slipper co-host, Megan Graeig. That girl does not hold back.</p>
