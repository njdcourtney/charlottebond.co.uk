I"ß<p>I offer editorial and proofreading services to both companies and individuals. I have worked with everyone from self-published authors to small presses and large online organisations. I can apply my skills to novels, novellas, short stories, articles, text books, marketing material, or anything else you send my way. As a reviewer for several websites, Iâ€™m very widely read, and Iâ€™ve had experience in a multitude of genres thanks to my ghostwriting.</p>
