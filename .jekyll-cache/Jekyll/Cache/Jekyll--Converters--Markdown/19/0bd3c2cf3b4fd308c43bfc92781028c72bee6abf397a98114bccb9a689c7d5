I"·<h3 id="horror">Horror</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re into horror, I urge you to check out <a href="https://www.adamlgnevill.com/">Adam L G Nevill</a>. He is a truly kind man who writes the most awful and grotesque horror. It might be a bit much for those with a weak stomach as I had to put down one of his books due to it making my morning sickness exponentially worse.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catriona-Ward/e/B015CNZSLK/">Catriona Ward</a> is a new name that is making a great impression. Her novel â€œRawbloodâ€ takes horror tropes and turns them on their head.</p>

<h3 id="fantasy">FANTASY</h3>

<p><a href="https://andrewknighton.com/">Andrew Knighton</a> is someone I am privileged to call a friend. He has a blog: <a href="http://andrewknighton.wordpress.com/">http://andrewknighton.wordpress.com/</a> which is filled with not only gems of wisdom but plenty of free flash stories too. If youâ€™re a fan of steampunk, heâ€™s the man for you!</p>

<p>Want an anti-hero? Then you should look up <a href="http://www.davidtallerman.co.uk/">David Tallermanâ€™s stuff</a>. A man who knows how to use a spreadsheet, Davidâ€™s output ranges from short stories to novels to comics and back again. He also doesnâ€™t write in a particular genre, so a good author if youâ€™re looking for something a little different.</p>

<p><a href="http://lucyhounsom.co.uk/">Lucy Hounsom</a> is one of my co-hosts on Breaking the Glass Slipper and writes some great high fantasy with a new feel to it.</p>

<p><a href="https://rjbarkerblog.wordpress.com/">RJ Barker</a> seems to be everywhere these days - and rightly so! His novels are filled with interesting characters and well-worth your time.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re into grimdark, then youâ€™ll love the work of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anna-Smith-Spark/e/B01M01O37N">Anna Smith Spark</a>. If youâ€™ve not tried grimdark before and want somewhere to start first, Iâ€™d recommend <a href="https://www.joeabercrombie.com/">Joe Abercrombie</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fairy-tales">FAIRY TALES</h3>

<p>If, like me, the darker side of fairy tales appeals, then you should definitely look out Naomi Novikâ€™s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Uprooted-Naomi-Novik-ebook/dp/B00SN93700/">â€œUprootedâ€</a> which is just amazing. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alison-Littlewood/e/B005VO5DJI/">Alison Littlewood</a> keeps her fairy tales grounded in our world and is fast growing into a classic writer.</p>

<p>And if youâ€™re new to reinvented fairy tales, then you should try out the classic: Angela Carterâ€™s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bloody-Chamber-Other-Stories/dp/0099588110/">â€œThe Bloody Chamber and Other Storiesâ€</a>.</p>
