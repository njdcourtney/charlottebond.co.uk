I"<p><strong><em>2019 is the year of the prince!</em></strong></p>

<p>Throughout 2018, I asked friends and contacts what they thought made a good princess. You can find the answers to those questions <a href="/categories/princequestions.html">here</a></p>

<p>This year, I will be asking authors from a variety of genres as well as a host of others from editors to academics, what they think makes a definitive prince.</p>

<p>This month we are joined by Angeline Trevena.</p>

<p>Angeline is a British science fiction, fantasy, and horror author. Creator of <em>The Paper Duchess</em> series, she is best known for her feminist brand of dystopia.</p>

<p>Sheâ€™s been writing stories since she was old enough to hold a pen, and after gaining a BA Hons degree in Drama and Writing, she honed her craft with horror and fantasy shorts which were published in numerous magazines and anthologies.</p>

<p>She also co-hosts <em>The Great Western Woods Worldbuilding Podcast</em> along with fellow author H.B. Lyne.</p>

<p>Angeline grew up on the edge of Dartmoor, Devon, amongst its legends and ghost stories but now lives in central England with her husband, their two young boys, and a somewhat neurotic cat.</p>

<p><strong>1. A prince has to win the trust not only of his people but of his chosen princess - and very quickly! What three qualities would you need a prince to show before youâ€™d be won over to their cause?_</strong></p>

<p>Humility has to be the biggest one. If he comes storming in on a showy stallion, acting like heâ€™s already won, then, no. Heâ€™s not winning me over. If he understands that scaling my tower (not a euphemism!) doesnâ€™t entitle him to anything, then weâ€™re cool.</p>

<p>Good sense of humour. I know itâ€™s a cliche, but itâ€™s a cliche for a reason. He has to be able to laugh at himself.</p>

<p>Third is generosity. He needs to generously bring me chocolate, and coffee, and kittens. Very important.</p>

<p><strong><em>2. All princes are armed, but what is the best weapon or weapons for a prince? (Magical weapons are allowed).</em></strong></p>

<p>Through my teens, I was a massive <em>X-Files</em> fan. I think Fox Mulder was one of my first proper crushes (along with Atreyu from <em>The Neverending Story</em>, because, of course). And, ever since Mulder, Iâ€™ve had a thing for guys in shirt sleeves with a shoulder holster. So, it might just have to be a good olâ€™ handgun. And, if he has a sandwich for me tucked in the other side, all the better. (I sense a theme emergingâ€¦)</p>

<p><strong><em>3. Disney princesses often have an animal companion to share their trials with. If the same applied to princes, what kind of animal would be a good choice for a prince?</em></strong></p>

<p>I could list loads of princely animals that I love: lions, bears, wolves, foxes, crows, hares. Theyâ€™d all be cool. But thereâ€™s this great book by Lauren Beukes: <em>Zoo City</em>. Itâ€™s in a world where, when someone does something wrong, an animal companion appears. And the funny thing is that it doesnâ€™t necessarily equate to the severity of their crime. So, you could have a psycho mass murderer with a fieldmouse, and a weasely corporate fraudster with a tiger. So, it would be funny for the animal to be completely at odds with their image.</p>

<p><strong><em>4. The Disney princes were a pretty unmemorable bunch. What kind of prince - or saviour-hero - would you like to see in future Disney movies?</em></strong></p>

<p>Itâ€™s so true! Can we have some big, hot, bearded, tattooed princes, please? And nerdy ones. I am a big fan of the hugely underrated Disney movie <em>Atlantis</em>, and Milo Thatch is so under-appreciated. I mean, look at the woman he gets; Kida is so hot! And he wins her over with his scholarly knowledge and bookishness (along with some very cute, awkward clumsiness). More of that, please!</p>

<p><strong><em>5. The focus on princesses is often what they wear, but what would be a good look for your ideal prince?</em></strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™ve thought hard about this, and Iâ€™m seriously torn. Like, nothing beats a really nice three-piece suit. It has to have a waistcoat. And, if he can ditch the jacket for rolled-up shirt sleeves, Iâ€™m in! I mean, why is that so sexy? I dunno, it just is.</p>

<p>But, honestly, the time I watched my husband cutting down trees in his full chainsaw gear, well, yeah. Seriously, there is something about guys cutting down trees and chopping wood. If youâ€™ve never watched a man chop wood, go and see it, youâ€™ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>So, anyway, can I have a mix of those two things?</p>

<p><strong><em>6. Which fictional prince is your favourite, and why?</em></strong></p>

<p>Like many women my age, my first Disney crush was Robin Hood. Yeah, I know that heâ€™s a fox, but if guys can have Ariel, we can have Robin Hood! In fact, I have a bit of a thing for Nick Wilde from <em>Zootropolis</em> too. Ok, maybe I have a problem.</p>

<p>Anyway, I donâ€™t think fiction offers us that many great prince characters. In general, princes do tend to be a little flat and, generally, blah. One group of princes I do really like are the brothers from Neil Gaimanâ€™s <em>Stardust</em>. Both the book and the movie. I love how pissed off they are about being dead; that feels so authentic. I think Iâ€™ll probably feel like that when itâ€™s my turn!</p>
