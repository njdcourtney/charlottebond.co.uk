I"µ<p><strong><em>2019 is the year of the prince!</em></strong></p>

<p>Throughout 2018, I asked friends and contacts what they thought made a good princess. You can find the answers to those questions <a href="/categories/princequestions.html">here</a></p>

<p>This year, I will be asking authors from a variety of genres as well as a host of others from editors to academics, what they think makes a definitive prince.</p>

<p>This month we are joined by Cheryl Morgan. Cheryl is a writer, editor and publisher, and the owner of Wizardâ€™s Tower Press. She also co-hosts the Womenâ€™s Outlook Show on Ujima Radio in Bristol <a href="https://www.ujimaradio.com">ujimaradio.com</a>. She plays a lot of funk.</p>

<p>You can find her online on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/CherylMorgan">@CherylMorgan</a>; at her blog, Cherylâ€™s Mewsings <a href="https://www.cheryl-morgan.com">Cheryl-morgan.com</a>; and at her fanzine, Salon Futura <a href="http://www.salonfutura.net">www.salonfutura.net</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>1. A prince has to win the trust not only of his people but of his chosen princess - and very quickly! What three qualities would you need a prince to show before youâ€™d be won over to their cause?</em></strong></p>

<p>A Prince should be a superb musician. All Princes are handsome by definition, and thereâ€™s not much call for fighting dragons these days. He might as well do something useful.</p>

<p>He should be a great teacher so that when he passes on he will have left behind him many brilliant musicians, especially women musicians, who claim him as their mentor and inspiration.</p>

<p>And finally, a Prince absolutely must have the funk.</p>

<p><strong><em>2. All princes are armed, but what is the best weapon or weapons for a prince? (Magical weapons are allowed).</em></strong></p>

<p>The signature weapon of the ideal Prince is the Axe. Of course, he should be the master of every instrument he chooses to lay his hands upon, but on stage a guitar is the only thing you can pose with properly.</p>

<p>It doesnâ€™t matter if the instrument is a Telecaster or a Stratocaster because thatâ€™s someone elseâ€™s song, but the blood of the guitar should always be Chuck Berry Red.</p>

<p><strong><em>3. Disney princesses often have an animal companion to share their trials with. If the same applied to princes, what kind of animal would be a good choice for a prince?</em></strong></p>

<p>Every Prince needs a steed. It is important to select the right one. It should have two wheels, not four. It should have custom styling with high bars and a passenger seat for his Princess to ride on. It should be painted purple and covered in gleaming chrome. It should wail like a banshee and run like the wind.</p>

<p><strong><em>4. The Disney princes were a pretty unmemorable bunch. What kind of prince - or saviour-hero - would you like to see in future Disney movies?</em></strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™m sure that the Prince I have described would be great in the movies. Every movie needs a great soundtrack, right? You could give it a punning title like, I donâ€™t know, <em>Purple Rain</em> maybe?</p>

<p>There should be an animated version, done by the same crew that did <em>Into the SpiderVerse</em>. With a guest appearance by Miles and SpiderGwen.</p>

<p><strong><em>5. The focus on princesses is often what they wear, but what would be a good look for your ideal prince?</em></strong></p>

<p>Something simple but flashy. A purple suit and white shirt?</p>

<p><strong><em>6. Which fictional prince is your favourite, and why?</em></strong></p>

<p>All Princes are fictional to some extent. They are pubic figures and adopt a persona to interact with their adoring subjects. Sometimes they also adopt a secret identity to add to the mystique. I find it amusing when that new identity is something unpronounceable such asâ€¦</p>
