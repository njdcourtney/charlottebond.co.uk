I"ý<p>I remember being bought my first proper horror book. It was Halloween and my father had driven us into Richmond to go shopping. On the way, weâ€™d passed Ellerton Abbey, whose long driveway had carved and lit pumpkins lining up each side in readiness for a  wedding. It was a fantastic sight, one which alas Iâ€™ve never seen repeated. (For a sense of scale, check out <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1729046">this picture</a> and imagine itâ€™s lined with carved pumpkins rather than snow).</p>
