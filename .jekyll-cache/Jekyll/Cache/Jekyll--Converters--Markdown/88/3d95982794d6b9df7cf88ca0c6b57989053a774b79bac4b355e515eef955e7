I"ø<p>I am member of the <a href="http://gingernutsofhorror.com/the-team.html">reviewing team</a> at the <a href="http://gingernutsofhorror.com/">Ginger Nuts of Horror</a> website. Jim McLeod is a top bloke and he offered me a position where not only do I get free books, but I also get to write what I think about them and someone publishes my opinions. Whatâ€™s not to like?</p>
