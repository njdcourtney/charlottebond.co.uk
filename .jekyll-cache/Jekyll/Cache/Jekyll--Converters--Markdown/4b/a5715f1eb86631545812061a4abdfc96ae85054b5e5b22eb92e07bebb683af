I"ƒ<p>In the previous blog, I looked at the real Saint Nicholas who was one of the key influences on our current Santa Claus. I say â€œone ofâ€ because, despite everyone thinking that the figure portrayed in Clement C Mooreâ€™s poem <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/visit-st-nicholas">â€œA Visit from Saint Nicholasâ€</a> (more commonly known as â€œTwas the Night Before Christmasâ€) is the epitome of the Santa we know and love, it turns out thatâ€™s far from the truth. And the popular theory that Santa wears red and white because of a Coca Cola advertising campaign is not as straightforward or as accurate as it may seem.</p>
