I"Ð<blockquote>
  <p>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br />
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.<br />
â€¦<br />
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.<br />
With a little old driver, so lively and quick<br />
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick. <br />
â€¦<br />
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.</p>
