I"ã<p>Today is William Shatnerâ€™s birthday and so has been honorarily named <a href="http://www.worldwideweirdholidays.com/international-talk-like-william-shatner-day/">Talk Like William Shatner Day</a>. Connoisseurs of diary dates will know there there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day">Talk Like A Pirate Day</a> and also a <a href="https://nationaldaycalendar.com/days-2/national-talk-like-shakespeare-day-april-23/">Talk Like William Shakespeare Day</a>, but such figures are internationally and historically recognised. Shatner is just one man, yet his voice has its own day. Why? Because his delivery is distinctive and, whilst often mocked, has become a cult classic all by itself.</p>
