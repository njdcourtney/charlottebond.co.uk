I"U<p>I am an author, ghostwriter, freelance editor, proofreader, reviewer and podcaster.</p>

<p>Under my own name I have written within the genres of horror and dark fantasy. Check out my “Novels and Novellas” section to see what I’ve published.</p>

<p>As a ghostwriter, I’ve tackled everything from romance to cozy mystery stories and YA novels. My articles have appeared in such places as <a href="https://www.tor.com/">Tor.com</a>, <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/">War History Online</a>, and Writing Magazine.</p>

<p>In addition to offering my editorial services to individual clients, I proofread for the website <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/">War History Online</a> and I’m also an editor for Fox Spirit books and a guest editor for Grimbold books. Editing is not only good fun but I also get real satisfaction from helping other people within the writing community.</p>

<p>I am a reviewer for the <a href="https://gingernutsofhorror.com/index.html">Ginger Nuts of Horror</a> website, as well as the <a href="http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/">British Fantasy Society</a> and the <a href="https://bd13books.wordpress.com/">Jane and Bex Book Blog</a>.</p>

<p>I am a co-host of the podcast, <a href="http://www.breakingtheglassslipper.com/">Breaking the Glass Slipper</a>, which is currently shortlisted for a BFS award for best audio and was long-listed for a Hugo.</p>

<p>I grew up in North Yorkshire, moved briefly to Durham for university, then settled in West Yorkshire. If I ever write a best-seller, I’d like to move back to North Yorkshire, or possibly Hawaii.</p>
