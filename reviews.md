I am member of the [reviewing team](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/the-team.html) at the [Ginger Nuts of Horror](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/) website. Jim McLeod is a top bloke and he offered me a position where not only do I get free books, but I also get to write what I think about them and someone publishes my opinions. What's not to like?

I've written quite a few reviews over there for the following books:

* The Antiquity of Dark Things by D.M. Keenan
* The Hidden People by Alison Littlewood
* The Village Witch by Neil Davies
* The Doll Man by William Couper
* The Factory by Mark West
* Concrete Grove by Gary McMahon
* Hex by Thomas Olde Heuvelt
* Forever Vacancy by various authors
* Mayhem by Sarah Pinborough
* The Scarlet Gospels by Clive Barker (and also a review of the original Hellraiser film )
* The Mothers by Mike Jones
* Luckyâ€™s Girl by William Holloway
* Campfire Chillers by Dave Jeffery
* The Pines by Robert Dunbar
* Terror Tales of the Lake District edited by Paul Finch
* The Final Winter by Iain Rob Wright (audiobook)
* Mountain Man by Keith C Blackmore (audiobook)
* Elf (film)
* Ghostbuster (film, 2018 version)
* The Force Awakens (film)

I've also conducted interviews with Keith C Blackmore and John Connolly.
