I am member of the [reviewing team](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/the-team.html) at the [Ginger Nuts of Horror](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/) website. Jim McLeod is a top bloke and he offered me a position where not only do I get free books, but I also get to write what I think about them and someone publishes my opinions. What's not to like?

I've written quite a few reviews over there for the following books:

* [Mayhem](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/4/post/2014/09/review-mayhem-by-sarah-pinborough.html) by Sarah Pinborough
* [The Scarlet Gospels](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/25/post/2015/05/the-scarlet-gospels-a-review.html) by Clive Barker (and also a review of the original [Hellraiser film](http://www.gingernutsofhorror.com/9/post/2014/09/charlotte-bond-opens-the-box.html) )
* [The Mothers](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/4/post/2015/10/the-transgression-cycle-the-mothers-by-mike-jones.html) by Mike Jones
* [Lucky's Girl](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/4/post/2015/02/horror-novel-review-luckys-girl-by-william-holloway.html) by William Holloway
* [Campfire Chillers](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/4/post/2014/08/horror-review-campfire-chillers-by-dave-jeffery.html) by Dave Jeffery

* [Terror Tales of the Lake District](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/4/post/2014/07/horror-review-terror-tales-of-the-lake-district-edited-by-paul-finch.html) edited by Paul Finch

I've also reviewed some audiobooks as I just love being able to indulge my passion for reading whilst also sweeping the floor or cleaning the bath:

* [The Final Winter](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/4/post/2015/01/audiobook-review-the-final-winter-by-iain-rob-wright.html) by Iain Rob Wright
* [Mountain Man](http://gingernutsofhorror.com/4/post/2015/01/horror-fiction-review-mountain-man-series-by-keith-c-blackmore.html) by Keith C Blackmore
