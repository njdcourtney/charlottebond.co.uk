I am an author, ghostwriter, freelance editor, proofreader, reviewer and podcaster. 

Under my own name I have written within the genres of horror and dark fantasy. Check out my “Novels and Novellas” section to see what I’ve published.

As a ghostwriter, I've tackled everything from romance to cozy mystery stories and YA novels. My articles have appeared in such places as [Tor.com](https://www.tor.com/), [War History Online](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/), and Writing Magazine. 

In addition to offering my editorial services to individual clients, I proofread for the website [War History Online](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/) and I’m also an editor for Fox Spirit books and a guest editor for Grimbold books. Editing is not only good fun but I also get real satisfaction from helping other people within the writing community.

I am a reviewer for the [Ginger Nuts of Horror](https://gingernutsofhorror.com/index.html) website, as well as the [British Fantasy Society](http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/) and the [Jane and Bex Book Blog](https://bd13books.wordpress.com/). 

I am a co-host of the podcast, [Breaking the Glass Slipper](http://www.breakingtheglassslipper.com/), which is currently shortlisted for a BFS award for best audio and was long-listed for a Hugo.

I grew up in North Yorkshire, moved briefly to Durham for university, then settled in West Yorkshire. If I ever write a best-seller, I’d like to move back to North Yorkshire, or possibly Hawaii.
