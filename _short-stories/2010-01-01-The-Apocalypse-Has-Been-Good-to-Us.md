---

A tale of one woman’s struggle to keep her family together in the aftermath of Armageddon. Demons roam the world, their hellish souls taking possession of anything electronic from androids to Dirkby Dingo’s Synthetic Pets. Nearly every home in the world had a Dingo pet; now nearly every home in the world has a demon living in it. But Mary and her family find that their demon, Sparky, has his own creative ideas on how they can all pull together and survive what has literally become hell on earth.

This short story came third in the British Fantasy Awards Short Story Competition 2009. It was then independently published in Dark Horizons in 2010.
