There's a hunger within all of us, but what will one woman do to sate that hunger? 

This story was included in "Dark Voices" released by Lycan Valley Press. [It's available here on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dark-Voices-Valley-Charity-Anthology/dp/0998748994/).

Praise for the anthology and "Just Below Our Feet" from Amazon reviewer:

*"Dark Voices is a great, meaty collection of short stories you can really sink your teeth into.*

*"All the stories are fun to read, and if you're a fan of short fiction where you don't have to keep reading to get through the novel, but instead have a chance to stop and ruminate about the stories that you've read, this is a great collection to half.*

*Of particular stand out to me, was Just Below Our Feet by Charlotte Bond, which I enjoyed very much."*
