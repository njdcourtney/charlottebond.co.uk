title: Twice or Forever
---

Thanks to the Treatment, Elizabeth has the face and body of a twenty-two year old, but a two hundred and seventy year old mind. Living forever has its pros and cons, but she wouldn’t give up immortality for anything. Her brother however, has a very cynical view of their way of life. But just how deep that cynicism, and what he’s prepared to do about it, is something that will shake Elizabeth’s world to its core.

This short science fiction story was published in the Earlyworks Press anthology "The Road Unravelled" which is available [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Road-Unravelled-Kay-Green/dp/0955342996/).
