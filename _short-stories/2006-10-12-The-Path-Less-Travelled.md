title: The Path Less Travelled
---

Sir Richard Beaufort is a disgraced knight who wants nothing more than to find solace at the bottom of a tankard of ale. He doesn’t care for the stranger who sits down opposite him, and he likes him even less when he discovers that he is unexpectedly in debt to him. But Guy Trevellyan has plans, and Richard Beaufort is a deliberate part of them. Together they might just succeed at a quest that is almost impossible.
