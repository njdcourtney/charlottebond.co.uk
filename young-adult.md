title: Young Adult

Through my own writing and ghost writing, I came to the conclusion that writing for young adults is where my heart lies. Some of my "adult" work is suitable for young adults to read and I've included them below, and checking out a free story from the Screaming Dream magazines is a good place to start.

Why write young adult? Because the teenage years are a time when you are breaking away from the traditions and rules of childhood; you are making your own rules, having your own ideas and creating your own values. Anything and everything is possible, but at the same time the darkness of the world is just starting to show around the edges...

### Into The Woods

Nan's baby brother, Unwin, was a changeling, or so her mother tells her. There's no way to be sure now since the fairies have taken him and not left the real Unwin in its place.

Yet while Nan and the rest of her family are content to have the insufferable child out of their lives, her little brother, Thom, can't abandon his baby brother to such an unknown fate.

When Thom sets out to rescue Unwin, Nan is forced to go with him or else risk losing two brothers. They travel into the woods where wonders and dangers beyond their wildest dreams and darkest nightmares await. They must use their wits and courage to survive in the strange and brutal land they now find themselves in. Because the fairies have come out to play, and they're very, very hungry.

These stories for the adult market would also probably appeal to young adult readers too.

### The Wild Hunt (horror)

Sally's idea is to take her children away for Christmas, somewhere that her ex-husband can't contact them. The Scottish cottage on the edge of the woods looks ideal, and the villagers seem eager to invite her and her family into their community. Only the Gathering on the winter solstice isn't just quaint tradition; it's the only way to avoid becoming prey to The Wild Hunt.

This is one of my favourite stories and was included in the 2009 Spinetinglers anthology which is available to buy [from Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spinetinglers-Anthology-2008-Matt-Leyshon/dp/1906657017/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1445263325&sr=8-3&keywords=spinetinglers+anthology). You can read the full story under their [Christmas 2006 section](http://spinetinglers.co.uk/ReadStory151.aspx) but you must be a user of the site to access it.

Praise for "The Wild Hunt" (as part of the Spinetinglers anthology)

"The best for me, "The Wild Hunt," where the veil between the living and dead is ripped open on the winter solstice." Ginahmk on Amazon.com reviews.

"Though I wasn't a fan of every story here (my own highlights [including] Charlotte Bond's `The Wild Hunt' ... ), they are diverse enough to appeal to individual tastes. - Peter Wolf on Amazon.com reviews.

### The Path Less Travelled (high fantasy)

Sir Richard Beaufort is a disgraced knight who wants nothing more than to find solace at the bottom of a tankard of ale. He doesn't care for the stranger who sits down opposite him, and he likes him even less when he discovers that he is unexpectedly in debt to him. But Guy Trevellyan has plans, and Richard Beaufort is a deliberate part of them. Together they might just succeed at a quest that is almost impossible.

My first published short story is part of Earlyworks Press' anthology "The Sleepless Sands, available to [buy here](http://www.earlyworkspress.co.uk/sleepless_sands.htm).
