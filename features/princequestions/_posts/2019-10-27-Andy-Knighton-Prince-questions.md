title: Andrew Knighton Prince Questions
---


**_2019 is the year of the prince!_**

Throughout 2018, I asked friends and contacts what they thought made a good princess. You can find the answers to those questions [here]({% link features/princessquestions/index.md %}) 

This year, I will be asking authors from a variety of genres as well as a host of others from editors to academics, what they think makes a definitive prince.

This month we are joined by Andrew Knighton. Andrew is a freelance writer, comics scribe, and author. His books include *The Epiphany Club*, a steampunk adventure set against the dark underbelly of the 19th century, available [here](https://books2read.com/u/md09vW)and *The Bear's Claws*, an alternate history war story available [here](https://books2read.com/bears-claws). 

He lives in Yorkshire with his cat, his computer, and a big pile of books. You can find stories from him at andrewknighton.com. Heâ€™s on Twitter as [@gibbondemon](https://twitter.com/gibbondemon).

**_1. A prince has to win the trust not only of his people but of his chosen princess - and very quickly! What three qualities would you need a prince to show before you'd be won over to their cause?_**

Compassion. It's something we don't focus on enough in male role models.

Intelligence. If I'm going to follow someone's lead, then I want them to be thinking things through.

Swordsmanship. Because if this is a fantasy or fairytale then they're going to need to hold their own in a fight, and if it's a modern prince then I'd rather be led by a larper.


**_2. All princes are armed, but what is the best weapon or weapons for a prince? (Magical weapons are allowed)._**

Helicopter gunship. No wicked witch is going to see that one coming.


**_3. Disney princesses often have an animal companion to share their trials with. If the same applied to princes, what kind of animal would be a good choice for a prince?_**

A monkey. Smart, agile, sociable, can hold your sword while you're warming up for a duel, and it'll deflate your enemy's posing by throwing poo at them.

What I'm saying is that Aladdin made the right choice, and I want to see the outtakes.


**_4. The Disney princes were a pretty unmemorable bunch. What kind of prince - or saviour-hero - would you like to see in future Disney movies?_**

A prince as the baddy, in a fairytale about overthrowing the monarchy.

A prince as a decadent scoundrel, full-on Beau Brummell meets Mick Jagger at Versailles, with the wine flowing and the outfits outrageous.

A prince who actually listens to the princess, values her advice, and doesn't assume she's there to meet his romantic needs.

Also Prince, in some kind of surreal Disney film/rock biopic mashup.


**_5. The focus on princesses is often what they wear, but what would be a good look for your ideal prince?_**

Renaissance prince meets 1970s punk - big boots, tight trousers, fitted doublet, all torn and held together with safety pins. When he takes off his enormous hat, there's a Mohican underneath.

For battle, he changes into armour so brightly polished that it hurts to look at, and he rides a crazy Da Vinci-style war wagon.


**_6. Which fictional prince is your favourite, and why?_**

Prince John in Disney's *Robin Hood*. A complete deflating of the idea of princes as heroes and monarchy as something noble. 

If you let a guy be in charge because his dad was in charge, and then you toss in some inbreeding, you're going to get chumps running the country. That's what happened with the real King John, and it's what happens with the Disney one.
