title: Tell a Fairy Tale Day
---

26th February 2018 is National Tell a Fairy Tale Day. In honour of that, I'm releasing a brand new story based on an old German legend.

You can download it for free here in [PDF](/static/free-story/Final Wish.pdf) and [ePub](/static/free-story/Final Wish.epub) formats.

If you enjoy this story, you might my dark fantasy novel [The Poisoned Crow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Poisoned-Crow-Charlotte-Bond-ebook/dp/B01GP1GEGQ) which is based around old fairy tales and available on Amazon Kindle.
