**_2019 is the year of the prince!_**

Throughout 2018, I asked friends and contacts what they thought made a good princess. You can find the answers to those questions [here]({% link categories/princequestions.md %}) 

This year, I will be asking authors from a variety of genres as well as a host of others from editors to academics, what they think makes a definitive prince.

This month we are joined Shane Huby - a real-life Flynn Ryder! Shane is a Leeds Graduate from Leeds Metropolitan University where he studied Games Design. He is interested in all aspects of theatre and film. He is an avid cosplayer and an experienced children's entertainer, which is how I met him when he was playing Flynn Rider to Susie Sparkle's Rapunzel.

**_1. A prince has to win the trust not only of his people but of his chosen princess - and very quickly! What three qualities would you need a prince to show before you'd be won over to their cause?_**

Charismatic, quick thinking, and a witty conversationalist. If they can entertain me, they are halfway there.


**_2. All princes are armed, but what is the best weapon or weapons for a prince? (Magical weapons are allowed)._**

Depends on the situation, I suppose. Can't go wrong with a classic sword and shield, although characters with more memorable weapons do tend to stick in our minds more. Hugh Jackman's automatic crossbow from *Van Helsing* would be pretty sick though.


**_3. Disney princesses often have an animal companion to share their trials with. If the same applied to princes, what kind of animal would be a good choice for a prince?_**

A grasshopper mouse warrior voiced by Brian Blessed. Never heard of a [grasshopper mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_mouse)? Google them, they are insane!


**_4. The Disney princes were a pretty unmemorable bunch. What kind of prince - or saviour-hero - would you like to see in future Disney movies?_**

The old school princes certainly. The likes of Snow White's prince, Sleeping Beauty's prince, and Prince Charming himself were kept simple to act just as a plot point and as someone for the leading lady to fall in love with.

On the other hand, "princes" such as Simba (*The Lion King*), Li Shang (*Mulan*), Kristoff (*Frozen*), Hercules, Aladdin and, of course, Flynn Rider from *Tangled* redefined the characters of princes. These later characters made Disney princes much more likeable, relatable, and enjoyable to watch.


**_5. The focus on princesses is often what they wear, but what would be a good look for your ideal prince?_**

Hmmm... interesting. I think to be an eye-catching prince you have to have both your royal garb and your "sneaking out of the castle to have adventures in the wild before realising that you aren't suited to the wild and need a princess to save you" attire. I have a feeling I'd certainly go for a more pirate-inspired dress sense.


**_6. Which fictional prince is your favourite, and why?_**

Pretty unorthodox and most likely unheard of by most of the masses, but my favourite prince has to be Prince Vegeta, the Prince of All Saiyans from the Anime *Dragonball Z/GT/Super*. After starting his story as a villain against the main protagonists, he undergoes the most character development. 

Even though he is not a kind, caring, or particularly friendly prince, he is an extremely strong fighter, a proud warrior, and an excellent character.
