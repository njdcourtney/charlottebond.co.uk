**_2019 is the year of the prince!_**

Throughout 2018, I asked friends and contacts what they thought made a good princess. You can find the answers to those questions [here]({% link categories/princequestions.md %}) 

This year, I will be asking authors from a variety of genres as well as a host of others from editors to academics, what they think makes a definitive prince.

This month we are joined by Cheryl Morgan. Cheryl is a writer, editor and publisher, and the owner of Wizard’s Tower Press. She also co-hosts the Women’s Outlook Show on Ujima Radio in Bristol [ujimaradio.com](https://www.ujimaradio.com). She plays a lot of funk.

You can find her online on Twitter as [@CherylMorgan](https://twitter.com/CherylMorgan) and at her blog, Cheryl’s Mewsings [Cheryl-morgan.com](https://www.cheryl-morgan.com).

**_1. A prince has to win the trust not only of his people but of his chosen princess - and very quickly! What three qualities would you need a prince to show before you'd be won over to their cause?_**


A Prince should be a superb musician. All Princes are handsome by definition, and there’s not much call for fighting dragons these days. He might as well do something useful.

He should be a great teacher so that when he passes on he will have left behind him many brilliant musicians, especially women musicians, who claim him as their mentor and inspiration.

And finally, a Prince absolutely must have the funk.

**_2. All princes are armed, but what is the best weapon or weapons for a prince? (Magical weapons are allowed)._**


The signature weapon of the ideal Prince is the Axe. Of course, he should be the master of every instrument he chooses to lay his hands upon, but on stage a guitar is the only thing you can pose with properly. 

It doesn’t matter if the instrument is a Telecaster or a Stratocaster because that’s someone else’s song, but the blood of the guitar should always be Chuck Berry Red.



**_3. Disney princesses often have an animal companion to share their trials with. If the same applied to princes, what kind of animal would be a good choice for a prince?_**


Every Prince needs a steed. It is important to select the right one. It should have two wheels, not four. It should have custom styling with high bars and a passenger seat for his Princess to ride on. It should be painted purple and covered in gleaming chrome. It should wail like a banshee and run like the wind.



**_4. The Disney princes were a pretty unmemorable bunch. What kind of prince - or saviour-hero - would you like to see in future Disney movies?_**


I’m sure that the Prince I have described would be great in the movies. Every movie needs a great soundtrack, right? You could give it a punning title like, I don’t know, *Purple Rain* maybe?

There should be an animated version, done by the same crew that did *Into the SpiderVerse*. With a guest appearance by Miles and SpiderGwen.



**_5. The focus on princesses is often what they wear, but what would be a good look for your ideal prince?_**


Something simple but flashy. A purple suit and white shirt?




**_6. Which fictional prince is your favourite, and why?_**

All Princes are fictional to some extent. They are pubic figures and adopt a persona to interact with their adoring subjects. Sometimes they also adopt a secret identity to add to the mystique. I find it amusing when that new identity is something unpronounceable such as…
