Jenny is furious when her mother moves them both to a self-sufficient commune. Jenny is determined to leave but, when she tries, she encounters an unnatural and terrifying presence.

Her new friend, Dan, is aware that there have been sinister goings on in Haven for some time. His home has become a place of unease and stalking shadows.

In the darkness of the surrounding forest, the two of them have to decide just who is more monstrous: whatever lurks in the trees, or the inhabitants of Haven itself.

This novella was published by Hersham Horror Press in September 2017 and is available on [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Monstrous-Charlotte-Bond-ebook/dp/B075FVLSR6/).
