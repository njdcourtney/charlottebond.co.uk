*Eat not, or be devoured yourself.*

It is well-known that the Devil holds an annual feast in the graveyard of St. Michael’s, a church in the small Yorkshire village in Kirkby Malham. But no one knows why.

On 19 November 1899, sexton Harry Kelsall finds himself an unwitting guest at the Devil’s feast, along with all the dead of the graveyard. If he doesn’t figure out how to break the feast’s curse, then he will forfeit his own soul at daybreak.

Harry knows the stories. He knows the legends. And none of them agree on how he should save himself. One wrong move will see him join the tormented souls around him, but if he does nothing, he will be just as damned.
