title: Ghost Writing
---

When I say I'm a ghostwriter, I usually get asked two questions:

1. What is ghostwriting? And then, when I've explained what it is, then comes the second question:
2. Who on earth would want someone else to write books for them? Why don't they just write the books themselves?

## What is a ghostwriter?

It's not as spooky as it sounds. Defined by the OED as "a person employed to writer material for another person, who is the named author". I write books for other people and then they publish them - that is, someone who writes books for clients which then get published under the client's name instead of mine.

## Who on earth would want someone else to write books for them? Why don't they just write the books themselves?

My clients are very diverse. Some are business people who have great knowledge in their field and want to impart that knowledge to others in the form of a text book. But they might not have the time to devote to such a project, so they provide me with all the relevant information and details such as the intended audience, and I write it for them.
Alternatively, my client might be someone who has had a story running around in their head for some time. But every time they try to commit it to paper, it doesn't sound quite the way they imagined. So they provide me with the plot, key details about the character, and I craft them a novel. It's their idea and my words coming together to make the book they always wanted to write.
