title: Editorial Services

I offer editorial and proofreading services to both companies and individuals. I have worked with everyone from self-published authors to small presses and large online organisations. I can apply my skills to novels, novellas, short stories, articles, text books, marketing material, or anything else you send my way. As a reviewer for several websites, I'm very widely read, and I've had experience in a multitude of genres thanks to my ghostwriting.

If you'd like to know my rates, you can contact me at charlotte.bond007@googlemail.com for a quote, or search for me on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com) as [BritWriter12](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/?nbs=1&q=BritWriter12).
