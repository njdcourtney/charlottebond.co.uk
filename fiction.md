*Eat not, or be devoured yourself.*

It is well-known that the Devil holds an annual feast in the graveyard of St. Michael’s, a church in the small Yorkshire village in Kirkby Malham. But no one knows why.

On 19 November 1899, sexton Harry Kelsall finds himself an unwitting guest at the Devil’s feast, along with all the dead of the graveyard. If he doesn’t figure out how to break the feast’s curse, then he will forfeit his own soul at daybreak.

Harry knows the stories. He knows the legends. And none of them agree on how he should save himself. One wrong move will see him join the tormented souls around him, but if he does nothing, he will be just as damned.

Maude has been the prisoner of a band of robbers since the spring. Now that winter has the land in its grip, her plight is looking even more desperate. As the dark nights draw in, so does her fate. For Grinning Jacob, the king of the robbers, is working on crafting a marriage bed and when it’s finished, it will be Maude’s bed.

But despite the daily horrors she faces, there are creatures in the surrounding forest that are even more dangerous than her captors. If Maude can find the courage to face them, she might escape yet, or she might find herself at the mercy of an ancient being both terrifying and insatiably hungry.
