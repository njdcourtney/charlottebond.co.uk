My first published piece was a fantasy piece in "The Sleepless Sands" anthology. This was followed up with "The Wild Hunt" on the Spinetinglers website, a story which was ultimately reprinted in their anthology. Since then, I've had published more fantasy, some science fiction, but mostly horror pieces. This culminated in a novella entitled "Hunter's Moon".

Praise for "The Wild Hunt" (as part of the Spinetinglers anthology)

"The best for me, "The Wild Hunt," where the veil between the living and dead is ripped open on the winter solstice." Ginahmk on Amazon.com reviews.

"Though I wasn't a fan of every story here (my own highlights [including] Charlotte Bond's `The Wild Hunt' ...), they are diverse enough to appeal to individual tastes. - Peter Wolf on Amazon.com reviews.

### The Path Less Travelled (high fantasy)

Sir Richard Beaufort is a disgraced knight who wants nothing more than to find solace at the bottom of a tankard of ale. He doesn't care for the stranger who sits down opposite him, and he likes him even less when he discovers that he is unexpectedly in debt to him. But Guy Trevellyan has plans, and Richard Beaufort is a deliberate part of them. Together they might just succeed at a quest that is almost impossible.

My first published short story is part of Earlyworks Press' anthology "The Sleepless Sands, available to [buy here](http://www.earlyworkspress.co.uk/sleepless_sands.htm).
