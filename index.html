      <p>2019 is the year of the prince!</p>
      <p>Throughout 2018, I asked friends and contacts what they thought made a good princess. 
        This year, I will be asking authors from a variety of genres as well as a host of others from editors to academics, what they think makes a definitive prince.</p>
