### Horror

If you’re into horror, I urge you to check out [Adam L G Nevill](https://www.adamlgnevill.com/). He is a truly kind man who writes the most awful and grotesque horror. It might be a bit much for those with a weak stomach as I had to put down one of his books due to it making my morning sickness exponentially worse.

[Catriona Ward](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catriona-Ward/e/B015CNZSLK/) is a new name that is making a great impression. Her novel "Rawblood" takes horror tropes and turns them on their head.

### FANTASY

[Andrew Knighton](https://andrewknighton.com/) is someone I am privileged to call a friend. He has a blog: [http://andrewknighton.wordpress.com/](http://andrewknighton.wordpress.com/) which is filled with not only gems of wisdom but plenty of free flash stories too. If you’re a fan of steampunk, he’s the man for you!

Want an anti-hero? Then you should look up [David Tallerman’s stuff](http://www.davidtallerman.co.uk/). A man who knows how to use a spreadsheet, David’s output ranges from short stories to novels to comics and back again. He also doesn’t write in a particular genre, so a good author if you’re looking for something a little different.

[Lucy Hounsom](http://lucyhounsom.co.uk/) is one of my co-hosts on Breaking the Glass Slipper and writes some great high fantasy with a new feel to it.

[RJ Barker](https://rjbarkerblog.wordpress.com/) seems to be everywhere these days - and rightly so! His novels are filled with interesting characters and well-worth your time.

If you're into grimdark, then you'll love the work of [Anna Smith Spark](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anna-Smith-Spark/e/B01M01O37N). If you've not tried grimdark before and want somewhere to start first, I'd recommend [Joe Abercrombie](https://www.joeabercrombie.com/).

### FAIRY TALES

If, like me, the darker side of fairy tales appeals, then you should definitely look out Naomi Novik's ["Uprooted"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Uprooted-Naomi-Novik-ebook/dp/B00SN93700/) which is just amazing. [Alison Littlewood](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alison-Littlewood/e/B005VO5DJI/) keeps her fairy tales grounded in our world and is fast growing into a classic writer.

And if you're new to reinvented fairy tales, then you should try out the classic: Angela Carter's ["The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bloody-Chamber-Other-Stories/dp/0099588110/).

### ART 

Like my cover photograph? Then you might like to check out [Sandra Cockayne’s other work found here](https://www.sandracockaynephotography.co.uk/).

Steve Upham is the master behind the designs of pretty much all my covers. His website will be up and running soon.
