#### Other writers you might like include:

If you're an adult and into horror, I urge you to check out [Adam L G Nevill.](http://www.adamlgnevill.com/) He is a truly kind man who writes the most awful and grotesque horror. It might be a bit much for a young adult audience or those with a weak stomach.

A great horror writer who has also written in both adult and YA is [Sarah Pinborough.](http://sarahpinborough.com/) I really like her Mayhem, but her YA book The Death House even scared Stephen King, so you know you're onto a good thing!

*On the fantasy side, there are a variety of authors you might like.*

Andrew Knighton - someone I am privileged to call a friend. He has a blog: http://andrewknighton.wordpress.com/ which is filled with not only gems of wisdom but plenty of free flash stories too. If you're a fan of steampunk, he's the man for you!

Want an anti-hero? Then you should look up [David Tallerman's](http://www.davidtallerman.co.uk/) stuff. A man who knows how to use a spreadsheet, David's output ranges from short stories to novels to comics and back again. He also doesn't write in a particular genre, so a good author if you're looking for something a little different.

#### Other stuff you might like

[Screaming Dreams Press](http://www.screamingdreams.com/) - many of my adult stories are published here, but it's also worth checking out Steve's [art section.](http://www.screamingdreams.com/artwork.html) There are some amazing pieces! Steve is the man responsible for some of my photos.

Like my cover photograph? Then you might like to check out [Sandra Cockayne's](http://www.sandracockaynephotography.co.uk/) other work.

[Utility Fog Press](http://www.utilityfogpress.com/) - one of my stories was printed in "Assassin's Canon" and if you enjoyed that then there are other books worth taking a look at.

I've never been published in [Dark Tales magazine](http://darktales.co.uk/) but they do have some fantastic stories!
